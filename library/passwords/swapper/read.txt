Both windows-password-grabber-gui-l.txt and enterpass.txt payloads are designed to be used together.
How this work is once someone logs out of windows using the windows key and the letter L these scripts will capture the new password once someone logs into the pc again. 
you will then be able to use the enterpass.txt payload to enter the password on the login screen anytime you want to with your set MATCH for our example mypass. 
enjoy.
